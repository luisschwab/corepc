# Run Bitcoin Core version specific tests.
#
# The `node` crate features are different from a normal crate because:
#
# - `node` cannot be built with --no-default-features
# - `node` expects at least one version feature e.g., --features=28_0
# - `node` supports downloading the Bitcoin Core binary and also running `bitcoind` from the host.
#
# In CI we always want to download the Bitcoin Core binary. This means we always enable `download`.
# Also, we always enable exactly one feature (even though multiple features will just cause the
# higher one to override the lower one).
